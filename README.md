# Dynamic proposal filtering bond model for DAOs

### For more information see https://ethresear.ch/t/dynamic-proposal-filtering-bond-model-for-daos/1983

This is a governance mechanism is a bond model which requires anyone submitting a proposal and requesting funds to post a bond which will be returned to them if the proposal is successful and forfeit otherwise.

There are directly measurable metrics that come with each proposal that can be used to evaluate it and calculate an appropriate bond. The most readily available metrics are the amount of funding the project is asking for, the amount of total funding available in the system (supply), and the amount of total funding requested by all pending proposals (demand). This also gives us, by proxy, the information on the proportion of total available funding a given proposal is requesting.
